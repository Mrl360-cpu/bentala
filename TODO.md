# TODO: Modernize Index Page

## Information Gathered
- index.html: Contains hero section with image slider, programs section with cards, call-to-action section, and decorative images.
- style.css: Green eco-theme with basic animations (fade-in, hover effects), responsive design.
- script.js: Slider functionality, typewriter effect, smooth scrolling, hamburger menu, form validation.
